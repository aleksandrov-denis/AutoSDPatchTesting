something went wrong at patch #7, only 4 records survived

patch #10 failed at LD .tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms2
and had a warning in arch/arm64/mm/init.c memblock_free(crash_base, crash_size)
the avg and var data will be from plain kernel

stopped proccess at the end of modules_install of patch 0120 because it was stuck and i didn't
want it to lock me out of the pi again since /lib/modules/KERNELVERSION already existed



TO_REDO:
patch 0120 --> todo
	make modules_install --> done
	make install --> done
	switch default --> done
	10 reboots --> done
	j2c --> done
test make modules_install when lib/modules/KERNELVERISON already exists
patch 0110 --> cannot
	function to patch does not exist in kernel source
patch 0113 --> cannot
	patch causes warning which then causes make to crash at LD .tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms2
	
continue script from patch 0121 --> todo
